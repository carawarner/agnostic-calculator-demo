# Agnostic Calculator Demo

![Travis](https://travis-ci.com/carawarner/agnostic-calculator.svg?branch=master)

This full-stack app showcases the [Agnostic Calculator](https://github.com/carawarner/pantheon), a Python3 library that parses strings representing mathematical expressions. It is number-type agnostic: a `Calculator` instance takes a `converter` which allows you to specify numerical types other than regular base 10. There is one converter available: `roman`.
